# Introduction

Welcome all to this blog post, I will be sharing my journey for the (Offensive Security(`offsec`) macOS Researcher) ethier the course content or the exam, And i will be giving a final review, Where i will be answering some questions & Giving some advice. Aside from a guide to the `OSMR` & How to prepare for it, And also it would be helpful even if you are planning to go with `macOS` Security Research & Exploitation.

## Back In Time

In my previous work as a Security Researcher, I had analyzed a `Dylib` Injection Vulnerability that affects `Telegram` App on `macOS`, The vulnerability leads to `TCC` Bypass, To analysis it in depth, I had to do learn multiple things such as, `macOS` basics, `Sandbox` in `macOS` how it works, `Dylib` what is it & how it works, What is `TCC` and many more. So I had built a few knowledge & skills regarding the `macOS` Research & Exploitation side. You can read my analysis for this vulnerability & also the exploit development for it:
1. [CVE-2023-26818 Part1: MacOS TCC Bypass with telegram using DyLib Injection](https://zeyadazima.com/macos/CVE_2023_26818_P1/)
2. [CVE-2023-26818 Part 2 (Sandbox): MacOS TCC Bypass W/ telegram using DyLib Injection](https://zeyadazima.com/macos/CVE_2023_26818_P2/)
3. [Exploit Writing Part 1: CVE-2023-26818 MacOS TCC Bypass W/ telegram](https://zeyadazima.com/macos/CVE_2023_26818_exploit_P1/)
4. [Exploit Writing Part 2: CVE-2023-26818 MacOS TCC Bypass W/ telegram](https://zeyadazima.com/macos/CVE_2023_26818_exploit_P2/)
After finishing the analysis for it, I had identifying some vulnerabilities with the same patterns in some `macOS` apps & got little more familiar with `macOS`.

# Studying

The content of the course is really brilliant & magniful. Mostly, you won't find that many resources for `macOS` in the security part, But there are still some resources around. The course covered a lot of topics.

> Note: Make sure to use `nomachine` app to access the lab machines, As the `VNC` service is too lame and slow., You can transfer `nomachine` app to the lab using `SSH`.




## The Course

What is really good about the course is that is using study cases from previously discovered vulnerabilities like `CVEs`, Where on each topic they teach the basics & internals of technologies then get some `CVEs` where start to discuss it, Analyze it, Developing an exploit for it and perform patch diffing to see how the vulnerability got patched. Which is a great way of learning in my opinion. In general the course is discussing everything on `Intel` architecture & There is only one module for `ARM` based architecture which is shellcoding.

The course starts with a basic introduction for `macOS` components and different technologies like the file type for `macOS` & the `mach` file architecture, Explaining it in detail, how to inspect it, etc. Then, It moves on using different tools for reverse engineering that are used for static and dynamic analysis, Which will be helpful when you conduct research on any app or `macOS` component as it will help you in understanding it and uncover hidden vulnerabilities. It was a basic and simple introduction, But it was useful, And it was practical as there are exercises to help you in practicing what you have learned. Also aside from learning`Objective-C` which was enough for the basic programming.

After that, It moves to shellcoding on both `Intel` & `ARM`. No difference between both except this one using `Intel` Assembly & The other one `ARM` Assembly, Both parts discussing the same topics and in the same ways with the architecture differences, Except for the `Shellcoding with C` which is mostly the same. It teaches also how to get rid of null bytes from your shellcode and optimize it. I was familiar with it as I passed through `OSED` and also my previous experience with assembly and other things, So it was easy for me.

Then, It moved with the `Dylib` Injection attacks First, Started with the `Dylib` technology and it's restrictions and how it's applied through `AMFI`, And how to identify and exploit `Dylib` attacks with different study cases, As I studied this one before i was already familiar with it, But going through the `AMFI` was new to me so i enjoyed it.

Following by that, Going with `Mach-IPC` starts with explaining `Mach-IPC`, How it works and The `Mach Microkernel`, Mach special ports, How to identify vulnerable apps & When the apps can be vulnerable to it, And how to exploit it step by step. And escalate the process to `POSIX` threat & linject a dylib. Basically, It was a pretty good simple module for learning `code injection`.

After that it goes to `XPC` Attacks, Starting with explaining `XPC` low level API & How it works in practice, Identifying and exploiting insecure `XPC`, Moving with `Hooking Functions`, Bypassing `Sandbox`, `TCC` & `GateKeeper`, Gaining kernel code execution and many more. Overall the course content was really enjoyable and amazing.
## Practicing

For the practicing in each module and topic you have exercises and extra miles, And the best thing it's all real world cases from widely used `macOS` Apps, Which will help you in having an overall idea on different cases of vulnerabilities or the patterns to it. Which helps you in general to build your own methodology and mindset in terms of `macOS` security research and exploit development. Side by that i was going around in apple security updates (old&new) ones, And check the updates in different versions to see the common patterns and common vulnerabilities found on it

# Exam

The exam contains `4` challenges as the following:
1. Challenge 1: 10 points
2. Challenge 2: 30 points
3. Challenge 3: 30 points
4. Challenge 4: 10 points

I started my exam on `23` of june at `4 PM` in almost total of few mins i already solved the first challenge for `10` points, I go for a quick nap, Then I came to the second challenge already identified the vulnerability and how to exploit it, I start writing the exploit code, And for like for few hours, I was just fixing errors with-in my exploit till i discovered that i was writing my exploit code out of the `main()` function, Which was the reason causing the error i faced xD, Finally, I fixed it i put my code inside of the `main()` function, And finally already pwned the second challenge with `30` points, Solving this challenge made me solve the 3rd challenge after it in only `4` mins and obtained another `30` points. To pass the exam you need a total of `70` points, Which i already obtained. I finished it all in the same day and finished my report all in the same day. To be honest, The exam disappointed me. It's pretty easy even if you have basic knowledge in `macOS` research, You would pass it. I was expecting it to be in the same level or more than `OSED`.

On `28` of june i received my results and already passed:

# Final Review

Now, I will share my final thoughts and review overall by answering some questions:
## Do i need something before start ?
Yes, You would also need assembly of both `ARM` & `Intel`. It will help you in making life easy as there is a lot of reverse engineering using `Hopper` in the course. So if you are familiar with `Hopper` & Assembly. It will make a lot of things easy for you. Also, It needs you to be strong in `C` and `Objective-C` if you really want to gain the knowledge and the skills in a right way, You got to have a strong understanding of `C` & `Objective-C` as there are a lot of exploit development, Shellcoding happening & Also source codes to read and understand. Aside from that, having a basic knowledge of `macOS` and its technologies like `XPC`, `TCC`, etc. Would really help you in obtaining the most of skills and knowledge in this content in a very clear way.

## Are Exercises & Extra Miles enough for the exam ?

If you just wanna obtain the certificate, I would say the course exercises and extra miles are really more than enough to obtain the certificate, because as i mentioned the exam is pretty easy. But if you are looking for more challenges you can follow my words in the `practicing`.

## Advice ?

- Practice on the exploit development part really well.
- Writing the exploits code on your way, Out of the way the course teaches you
- Make sure to review the code `syntx` and structure cause some errors are triaged because of small mistakes like the one i mentioned.
- Go around internet resources related to `macOS`, Such as the talks in `BlackHat`, etc. It will help you a lot
- If you want to go further, Dive deep into the books and use the `macOS` as a developer first.
- Practice, Practice, Practice!

# OSMR Resources
Now, As the resources not that much i will discuss some of resources i got around that you can use in general ethier for `OSMR` or `macOS` Research in general:
- ***OS Internals**: https://newosxbook.com/jbooks.html

The *OS Internals Books are really amazing and worth every min of reading, The 3 parts discussing internals in terms of `user` mode, `kernel` mode and the last part for security and it's even discussing some zeroday discovered before like the one used in pegasus software to obtain access through ZeroClick RCE.
